# Just a list of stuff I use on Linux or OSX (incomplete)
1. Vim - bruh...
2. Tmux - terminal multiplexing, enhancing dat terminal life
4. [Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - quickly move around server
   directory through auto-aliasing
3. [Tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) - 90% of the time I just want to
   see some examples and not read through man... used to use 
   [Bro-pages](http://bropages.org) but I don't think it's being developed any
   more
4. [Jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - json parser and pretty printer
5. [CCat](https://github.com/jingweno/ccat) - cat looks gross, need syntax
   highlighting
6. [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - quickly browse files... I often
   find myself looking through logfiles to check on progress... opening and
   closing files is inneficient
